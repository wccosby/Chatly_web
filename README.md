# Chat.ly
Web platform to quickly and easily create A.I. powered customer service systems for any product or service.

Built for my final project in Metis Data Science bootcamp.

# Tools and Technologies Involved
* Python and TensorFlow for Deep Neural Networks.
* Custom implementation of a Dynamic Memory Network with high-dimensional word vectors. Flask, AWS, and MongoDB for hosting service online and storing data.
* API for easy integration into any external service.
* Designed to dynamically crowd-source training data from multiple users, ensuring that as the system grows it also gets smarter.

# Dynamic Memory Network
To understand this structure more, see my blog post, http://willcosby.com/?p=5990, where I explain the system and also point to the original academic papers that explored this topic.
